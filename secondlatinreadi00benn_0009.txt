PREFACE

THE favour which my EASY LATIN STOROES have meh

with has induced me to puhlish another easy Reader.
Some passages from Classical writers appear iu Part I.
Part ΠΙ. is an adapiation from Quintus Curtius. The
Notes will enable young boys to dispense with the use os
a Classical Diefflonary, and I hope the book may also be
useful in giving a slighb sketch of the leading events of

Roman and Grecian History.
