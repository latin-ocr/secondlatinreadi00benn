THE most important and the most difficult point in historical teaching is
to awaken a real interest in the minds of beginners. For this purpose
concise handbooks are seldom usesul. Genera] sketches‚ however accurate
in their outlines os political or constitutional development, and however
well adapted to dispel salse ideas, still do not make history a living thing
to the young. They are most valuable as maps on which to trace the

route beforehand and show its direction, but they will seldom allure any
one to take a walk.

The object of this series of Historical Biographies is to try and select
from English I-Iistory a sew men whose lives were lived in stirring times.
The intention is to treat their lives and times in some little detail, and to
group round them the most distinctive features of the periods before and
aster those in which they lived.

It is hoped that in this way interest may be awakened without any
sacrifice of accuracy, and that personal sympathies may be kindled with-
out sorgetfulness of the principles involved.

It may be added that around the lives of individuals it will be possible
to bring together facts of soeial life in a clearer way, and to reproduce a
more vivid picture of particular times than is possible in a historical
handbook.

By reading short biographies a sew clear ideas may be formed in the
pupil’s mind, which may stimulate to further reading. A vivid impres-
sion osone period, however short, will carry the pupil onward and give
more general histories an interest in their turn. Something, at least, will
be gained if the pupil realises that men in past times lived and moved
in the same sort of way as they do at present.
