AUTHOR 01² ‘PROGRESSWE EXERCISES IN LATlN ELEGIAC VERSE.'

‘ Whatever may be thought of this work as compared with previous editions, the editor
ventures to claim for it the merit of greater simplicity of arrangement. The footnotes,
which have been reserved mainly sor explanations of technical words, are fewer, and
less crowded with matter; the familiar finger-posts exist no longer; the subtle distinc-
tion between numerals above the line with a curve and those without a curve has been
abandoned ; while a glance at the Table of Contents will show that a definite plan has
¹been followed indthe order of the Exercises, the object being to keep in view the stern-

ormatton or wor s.

'The principa! novelties in the present edition are the following :—Reserenees have
been made throughout to the “ Public School Latin Primer,” the phraseology of which
is generally adopted ; the formation of words from the Stem is taught from the first : the
constructions of the Cases and of the Verb-Noun are fully treated ; the Exercises have
been almost entirely re-written, and are longer: anecdotos. sableS, etc„ have been in-
serted into the passages for translation into English ς some fifty test Exercises have been
added : and lastly, a General Index has been carefully compiled, by which the search sor
particular rules or constructions will be greatly facilitated.'-Extract from tlte Prffaca
