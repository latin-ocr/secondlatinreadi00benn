HISTORY OF ROME.

tives than Latin. We say, ‘before the foundation (abstract) of
Rome ;’ the Latins said, ‘ b‘efore Rome founded.'

Etrusci—the Etrurians, Etruseans, or Tuscans. Hence Tuscany.
Their country was immediately to the north of Latium, the Tiber
being the frontier.

decora—‘ embellished. ’

datur—antiquitati—‘to antiquity is conceded this privilege.’ The
clause introduced by ut explains venia (ut consecutive).

2. Vestalis virginis—the Vestal virgins tended the holy fire of Vesta,
the goddess of the hearth.

Palatino—one of the seven hills on which Rome stood.

quorum ageret —the relative takes the subjunctive because it is
cqual to ut eorum, and therefore has a final force.

Sabinis—the inhabitants of Central Italy.

near Rome, inhabited by Sabines.

4. Albanos—the inhabitants of Alba Longa, the most ancient town of
Latium, said to have been founded by Ascanius, the son of the
Trojan Aeneas, who fied to Italy after the fall of Troy. Romulus
belonged to the royal house of Alba.
